# Mastering React Project

This is a React learning project focused on mastering React concepts, hooks, and best practices. The project contains educational examples, interactive demos, and comprehensive documentation for React development.

## Project Rules

### TypeScript Rules

- Use "function" keyword for top-level functions, arrow functions for callbacks
- Prefer "type" keyword over "interface" for abstract type definitions
- Prefer named exports over default exports if possible
- Always use curly braces and single quotes
- Use const objects instead of enums

### React Components Rules

- Use functional components and TypeScript types
- Use declarative JSX
- Use function keyword for component function, NOT arrow functions
- Use CSS modules for styling, do not use Tailwind
- Exported component should be first in the file, secondary components and util functions should go next after it, always maintain the same order
- Place static content and types at the file end
- Refer to the latest React documentation for best practices
- Use components composition to reduce complexity
- Prefer named exports over default exports where it's possible
