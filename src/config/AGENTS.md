# Configuration Rules

- This folder is for static constants and enumerations
- Use const objects instead of enums for better tree-shaking
- Group related constants together in logical modules
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose
- Export constants as named exports
- Keep configuration values centralized and easily maintainable
- Use TypeScript types for better type safety
- Document complex configuration objects with JSDoc comments
