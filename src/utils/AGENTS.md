# Utility Functions Rules

- This folder is for generic pure utility functions
- Each function should be covered with unit tests
- Functions should be pure (no side effects, same input always produces same output)
- Use descriptive names that clearly explain what the function does
- Include proper TypeScript types for parameters and return values
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Export functions as named exports
- Follow functional programming principles
- Document complex functions with JSDoc comments
