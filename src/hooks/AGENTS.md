# Reusable Hooks Rules

- This folder is for reusable generic React hooks
- Hooks should have self-explanatory names that clearly describe their purpose
- Follow React conventions and best practices for custom hooks
- Use the "use" prefix for all hook names
- Hooks should be pure functions that can be used across different components
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Follow React hooks rules (no conditional calls, proper dependencies, etc.)
- Document hook parameters and return values with TypeScript types
