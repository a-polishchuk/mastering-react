Key Principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate TypeScript examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).
- Favor named exports for components.

JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use "function" keyword for pure functions and top level functions.
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer types over interfaces. Avoid enums, use maps.
- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content.
- Always use curly braces for all code blocks.
- Use single quotes for strings.

React

- Use functional components and TypeScript types.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use function, not const, for components.
- Use CSS modules for styling, do not use Tailwind.
- Place static content and interfaces at file end.
- Refer to the latest React documentation for best practices.
