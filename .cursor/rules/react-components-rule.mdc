- Use functional components and TypeScript types.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use function keyword for component function, NOT arrow functions.
- Use CSS modules for styling, do not use Tailwind.
- Exported component should be first in the file, secondary components and util functions should go next after it, always maintain the same order.
- Place static content and types at the file end.
- Refer to the latest React documentation for best practices.
- Use components composition to reduce complexity.
- Prefer named exports over default exports where it's possible.
