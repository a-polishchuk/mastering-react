- Use "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Use arrow functions only for callbacks and inlined anonymous functions.
- Prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums, use objects with const assertion instead.
- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content.
- Always use curly braces for all code blocks, even if it's a one-liner.
- Use single quotes for strings.
