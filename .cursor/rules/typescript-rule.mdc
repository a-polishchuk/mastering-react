- Use "function" keyword for top-level functions, arrow functions for callbacks
- Prefer type aliases over interfaces
- Use const objects instead of enums
- File structure: exports, subcomponents, helpers, static content
- Always use curly braces and single quotes
- Use named exports over default exports
